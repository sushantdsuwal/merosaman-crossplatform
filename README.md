This little project is my humble attempt two bridge to worlds ðŸš . The world of web apps and the world of native apps. Using [react native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) and [react dom](https://reactjs.org/). Majority of code share the same base. This means that almost every screen and component you see is a universal one, shared between those two platforms. This reduces the codebase to maintain, thus reducing the cost of development ðŸ’°!
